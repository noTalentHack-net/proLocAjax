# Youth Program Locator draft version
Changed form.html, form.css and added progList.js

A couple of things that I noticed when I got the search to work... there are 88 programs in total. If you check everything then only 82 programs will result. This is because not all of the columns are filled out for certain programs... nothing we can really do unless they update their table.

Certain check boxes from "Times Offered" doesn't work yet. I have to figure out how to use the commas.

I need to finish the search query and program categories next.
